This is not display math. It is inline math:

$$\text{first $$ second}$

$$$\text{first $$ second}$

This is display math:

$$\text{first $$ second}$$

$$$\text{first $$ second}$$

This is also display math, but (counterintuitively) it's allowed to be empty
and expected to be as short as possible:

$$$$\text{first $$ second}$$
